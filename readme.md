# Yahtzə! (Yahtzee dice game) – Feature extension bootcamp project with React and Express

## What

Fullstack bootcamp project. Feature extension of another student's MVP project.

Uses React, React Router, JWT authentication, bcrypt password hashing, Pico CSS, Express, SQL, MySQL.

Allows logged-in users to multiple full games of [**Yahtzee**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahtzee). Saves game data to backend.

## Front end only version

If you want to play the game and aren’t interested in the backend and authentication aspects, I have a [repo](https://github.com/niamh-d/yahtzee-just-the-game) with **just the front-end** without any signup/login or user details, and which saves to **local storage** (rather than DB).

## Imagined Scenario

I have been asked by my PM to build upon code already written by a collegue.

### Criteria/Constraints:

- Maintain aesthetic as much as possible while adding required new features and with (below) design inspiration in mind
- Style with vanilla CSS as much as possible (no or minimal external libraries or frameworks)
- Incorporate existing dice and dice roll animation

### Required new features

- Full Yahtzee game logic (DONE)
- Redesign of app to incorporate below features (DONE)
- Scoreboard (DONE)
- Log in and sign up pages and logic (DONE)
- Saving user scores to backend (DONE)

### If time allows:

- Authentication and password hashing (DONE)
- Display previous play history (DONE)
- Navbar (DONE)
- Permit two players to play against each other in same session (NOT DONE)
- Play against computer (NOT DONE)

## Design

## Running

### Start expresss server

1. In the terminal run:

```
npm start
```

Don't kill it; let it run.

### Start frontend dev server

2. In a fresh, second terminal run:

```
cd client
npm run dev
```

Don't kill it; let it run.

### Run mysql

3. In a third terminal run:

```
mysql -u root -p
<enter your mysql password>
USE dice;
```

Or if you already have set up mysql so you skip entering password:

```
mysql
USE dice;
```

Fin!

## Setting up project

### Open project in VSCode

1. Once the project is on your machine, drag the folder and drop it in VSCode to open it or run the [shortcut](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-open-visual-studio-code-from-your-terminal/):

```
cd <path to project directory>
code .
```

### Add DOT env with your DB password

2. Create a .env file at the top level of your project with the following (all other details are already in the model/database.js file)

```
DB_PASS=<your password>
DB_USER=<your username>
```

### Create DB

3. Open up the terminal in VSCode and run

```
mysql -u root -p
<enter your mysql password>
CREATE DATABASE dice;
```

Or if you already have set up mysql so you skip entering password:

```
mysql
CREATE DATABASE dice;
```

You can kill terminal.

## Installation steps

### Install backend packages and set up db tables and populate with initial data

1. In the terminal run:

```
npm i
npm run migrate
```

### Install frontend packages

2. In the same terminal run:

```
cd client
npm i
```
